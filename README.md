wish.list is an online shopping tool helping customers keep more money in their pockets. It changes the game by letting you choose the price. Based on strategies from market investing, wish.list saves you money by implementing a buy limit. First, customers sign up with wish.list and link a form of payment to their secure account. Then, customers browse for an item they want to buy and choose a buy limit: the maximum price they are willing to pay. If the item price ever falls to/below the buy limit, then it will be automatically purchased and delivered to the customer.
