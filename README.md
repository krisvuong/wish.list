wish.list is an online shopping tool helping customers keep more money in their pockets. It improves the online shopping experience by letting the user choose the price that works for them. Based on strategies from market investing, wish.list saves customers money by implementing a buy limit into every online purchase. First, customers sign up with wish.list and link a form of payment to their secure account. Then, customers browse for an item and choose a buy limit: the maximum price they are willing to pay. If the item price ever falls to/below the buy limit, then it will be automatically purchased and delivered to the customer.
